    <h1>I'M KIDDING</h1>
    <p>
      No <a href="chapter1.html">jokes</a>. That's what I thought, but I'm happy
      to be who I am today and where I have gone so far. I'm grateful for any
      opportunities that I had, have, and will have. I know a lot of inspiring
      people, and I learn so much from them. Although it's hard, i will keep
      going to find my peace. I appreciate everything.
